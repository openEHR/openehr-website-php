				<p>In his early professional years, Sebastian developed complex web-based applications for the healthcare sector in Romania and later on in The Netherlands.

After receiving an Engineering degree in Automation and Computer Science, Sebastian focused on developing a completely new PHP-based implementation of openEHR specifications. In 2010, he became one of the three founders of <a href="http://www.openehr.org/industry_partners/code24">Code24 BV</a>, and has since been the lead software engineer within this company.
