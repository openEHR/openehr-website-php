			<p>The openEHR Industry Partners are a group of companies implementing openEHR who have agreed to materially support the Foundation. The list below is the initial group, present at a meeting in September 2013, documented in <a href="http://www.openehr.org/news_events/foundation_news.php?id=87">this news item</a>. The industry partners will support the foundation with resources, both human and financial. They will work on many aspects of openEHR, but in particular, are focussed on product compliance and quality. To that end, they are developing conformance specifications for openEHR.</p>
